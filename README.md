1.a)  "version control system" like Git, this system keeps a record of all the changes made to the computer code and makes sure everyone is using the latest version.
GitHub is a popular tool that uses Git to help teams work together on code. It also adds features for tracking issues and managing projects, making it easier for everyone to collaborate.

b) To create a new branch in Git, you can use the "git branch" command followed by the desired branch name. Afterward, you can switch to this new branch using the "git checkout" command followed by the branch name. This way, you can work on different aspects of your project independently within separate branches.

c) Cloning a Git repository makes an exact copy of all the files and changes in that repository. Usually, we clone remote repositories hosted on the internet. When we do this, we create a local version on our own computer. This local copy lets us experiment without affecting the original code.

d) Committing changes in Git means creating a new "version" of your project with those changes. It involves two steps:

Adding Changes to Staging: Use "git add" to stage changes for a commit. For example, "git add file1.js" stages changes in "file1.js." You can also stage multiple files, like "git add src/file2.js." "git status" shows the status of your changes.
Taking a Snapshot: Create a commit with the staged changes using "git commit -m "message."" This records the changes, and "git log" displays all the commits. After a commit, the staging area is empty.
After these steps, "git status" confirms an empty staging area.

e)A pull request is a way for developers to suggest changes to a hosted code repository. It's mainly used for teamwork, checking code quality, and discussing the changes before adding them to the main project.
